## TODO:
[] compare forecasts for emergent-only, emergent-combined and non-emergent encoding for matrix-factorisation (3 separate models trained. one batch predicted each, combine into 3-batch)
[] compare forecasts for emergent-only, emergent-combined and non-emergent encoding for transformers
[] extract emergent features
[] metrics
